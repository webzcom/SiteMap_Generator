# SiteMap Generator V 1.0 for Windows

---

This version is missing the filter feature that I'll be adding soon

## How to Use
1. Change URL variable to point at your own website.
2. Update your URL filters in the filterArray
3. Save your changes
4. Double click .vbs file to run
5. Sitemap.xml file should generate in the same folder as the script
